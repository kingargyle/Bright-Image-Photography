<p>Anyone with a camera can capture a kiss or a hand being held, but we capture YOUR STORY! From the engagement photos to the big day itself let us TELL YOUR STORY!!!</p>
<p>Our goal is to capture the best memories of your senior year in high school. We don’t want the same old posed and boring picture with a stiff smile held firmly in place. For this reason we spend more time focusing on your wants and likes then a typical studio would. The time we take to understand your desire helps used CAPTURE YOUR BRIGHTEST STORY!!!</p>
<p>Our studio shots are creative and fun, while our outdoor shots capture you doing what you love doing. We can take pictures at your house, at a local landmark or park, all for the same cost as most studios charge for doing studio shots. We will not quit or be satisfied with any image unless you are happy with the final product.</p>
